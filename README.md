# flipkart_review_sentimentanalysis

## Overview

This project implements sentiment analysis to classify customer reviews as positive or negative and understand the factors influencing customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. By analyzing the sentiment of reviews, we aim to gain insights into product features that contribute to customer sentiment.

## Features

- Text Cleaning: Remove special characters, punctuation, and stopwords from the review text.
- Text Normalization: Perform lemmatization or stemming to reduce words to their base forms.
- Numerical Feature Extraction: Apply techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec (W2V), and BERT models for feature extraction.
- Model Selection: Train and evaluate various machine learning and deep learning models using the embedded text data.
- Evaluation Metric: Use the F1-Score as the evaluation metric to assess the performance of the models in classifying sentiment.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 8,518 reviews for the "YONEX MAVIS 350 Nylon Shuttle" product from Flipkart. Each review includes features such as Reviewer Name, Rating, Review Title, Review Text, Place of Review, Date of Review, Up Votes, and Down Votes.
